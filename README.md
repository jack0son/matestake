# MateStake

**Get a mate to keep you accountable**

Ask a friend to hold your ETH ransom on the condition that you complete a task.

1. Stake some ETH on your task with a time limit
2. Assign a mate's ETH address to be the task's referee.
3. Complete your task and tell your mate.
4. Your mate does due diligence and verify the task they believe you
5. Your stake is refunded

For every block past the deadline you will get slashed.
